Introductory sensitivity analysis ML project for Intro to DS Metis course

1) What is the question you hope to answer?

Perform sensitivity analysis on airline twitter tweets to determine sentiment level that will allow us to answer the question: Given a particular tweet, is it positive, negative or neutral? How accurate is the prediction? Can we further improve the accuracy by the use of different features, different models, tuning hyperparameters?

2) What data are you planning to use to answer that question?

Twitter US Airline Sentiment
Analyze how travelers in February 2015 expressed their feelings on Twitter

3) What do you know about the data you're using so far?

I am familiar with Twitter and structure of tweets in general, but this is the first time I've seen the dataset. It is pretty self explanatory with main feature being the tweet ('text' in this instance) and 'airline_sentiment' (positive, negative, or neutral) the label.

4) Why did you choose this topic?

NLP is very widely used in the world today and analyzing text is something I find interesting.
